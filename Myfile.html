<p><h4 >One of the most common <a title="Induction motor"  hreflang="en" target="blank" href="https://www.electrical4u.com/electrical-motor-types-classification-and-history-of-motor/">
<em>electrical motor</em></a> used in most applications which is known as induction motor. This motor is also called as asynchronous motor because it runs at a speed less than its synchronous speed.
Here we need to define what is synchronous speed. Synchronous speed is the speed of rotation of the magnetic field in a rotary machine and it depends upon the frequency and number poles of the machine. An induction motor always runs at a speed less than synchronous speed because the rotating magnetic field which is produced in the stator will generate flux in the rotor which will make the rotor to rotate, but due to the lagging of flux current in the rotor with flux current in the stator, the rotor will never reach to its rotating <a title="magnetic field" target="blank" href="https://www.electrical4u.com/what-is-magnetic-field/"><em>magnetic field</em></a> speed i.e. the synchronous speed.</h4> </p>
